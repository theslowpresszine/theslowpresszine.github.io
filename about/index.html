	<h1>We squeeze the juice.</h1>
	<p>The Slow Press is an independent food magazine fixated on the rich stories behind what we eat.</p> 
 
	<p>Through longform journalism, design, illustration, photography, and videography, the magazine seeks to bring Singapore’s vibrant food heritage to the foreground in an introspective, yet quirky and fun way. We want to shed light on the ways of looking at food to help you truly appreciate the goodness that goes into your stomach.</p>

	<p>We're not food critics or industry professionals – we strongly believe in the power of telling stories about and through food. You won't find restaurant reviews or listicles about the top places to eat. Our juice is refreshing and revolutionary – what you'll get in the zine are pieces crafted with nothing less than our dedication to casting insights into Singaporeans' rich and diverse relationships with food. </p>

	<p>Aside from our digital and print offerings, we enjoy cooking up a storm in the kitchen and sharing the joy of eating with our food-loving community at our zine drop parties that we hold with every launch. We’re always game for thought-provoking conversations on food and interacting with our readers through Instagram has allowed for us to indulge in these meaningful discourses.</p>

	<p>If you have a story to share with us or would like to join the family of juice junkies, drop us a hello with your writing samples/design portfolio at <a href="mailto:theslowpressmagazine@gmail.com?subject=Hello!">theslowpressmagazine@gmail.com</a>.</p>
