	<p> This capsule collection by The Slow Press &times; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yabaiyabai__/">Yabai Yabai</a> (Stacy Tan) encapsulates the meaning of this quintessentially local term, inspired by the labour of love and the vibrancy of Singapore's wet markets.</p>

	<p>There’s so much to discover from merely being there and soaking in the sights and sounds–through this collaboration, we’ve recreated the familiar and passed down these artefacts, in a meaningful way, to someone who finds the same joy in craftsmanship and wet markets.</p>
	
	<p>Designed by Stacy, we’ve turned our all too familiar leaves–banana leaves, bamboo leaves, lotus leaves, betel leaves, and coconut leaves–into a vibrant print on a TRIANGLE MARKET BAG that you can WRAP all your essentials up when you go gaigai!</p>

	<p>Just like how we use leaves as plates, we’ve made WASHABLE PLACEMATS AND COASTERS to be part of your meals! Handsewn with lots of love, we believe that these earthy green colours with pink accents will make you feel relaxed at home and in the great outdoors.</p>

	<p>Meet our AROMA RANGERS - power rangers turned delicious, inspired by the building blocks of our local cuisines. We have the SPICE GIRLS–ginger, galanGAL and turmeric, calaMANsi, and haebi HUMAN!</p>

	<p>Drawn by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/melhoonkway/">Melody Koh</a>, we’re bringing these designs to life at our GAIGAI collection launch. We silkscreened these rangers on canvas pouches that are perfect for storing your own aroma rangers when you go gaigai at the wet markets. You can also just put in your phone, wallet, and keys!</p>

	<p>Each pouch features one aroma ranger of your choice, with the other side featuring the aroma rangers logo because you are a champ for loving our aromatics! Each pouch comes with a 16-page 6x6cm mini zine with a comic about Aroma Rangers.</p>

	<p>SCHOOL OF FISH is an upcycled project that originated from the idea of using scrap fabric from Yabai Yabai's studio to create something new. We also thought it would be fun and meaningful if more people were a part of it and contributed their own fabrics to the project! Thanks to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rookies.coffee/">Rookie's Coffee</a> for hosting our collection drive; we managed to gather many kinds of prints and patterns to make 5 different fishes for the collection.</p>

	<p>The fish are small drawstring pouches that can fit your phone, keys and a card holder when you go for small gaigais or tiny walks to have breakfast with your kakis. There are only 15 pieces available.</p>
